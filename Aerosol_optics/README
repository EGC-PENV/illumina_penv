Readme file for aerosol optical properties in illumina

Illumina defines 3 aerosol models (urban, maritime, rural).
All of them having a fixed vertical scale height of 2 km.
The size distribution and composition were determined from Shettle and
Fenn 1979. For the optical calculations we used the complex refractive
index defined in OPAC v3.1 (salt, soot, waso (water soluble), inso 
(insoluble).

The calculation were made with utils/mietool assuming spefical particles
with homogeneous mixing of water for salt and waso. The codes are
derived from B. Evans Mie code.

For Fog and Dust, we used the scattering to extinction ratios and phase 
functions provided by OPAC v3.1 package. We simply interpolated to the 
angles and wavelength used in illumina. 

For dust, we used the miam00 file (mineral accumulation mode)

# size distribution: lognormal
# ------------------
#
#   minimum radius, [um]:      5.000E-03
#   maximum radius, [um]:      2.000E+01
#                  sigma:      2.000E+00
#       Rmod (wet), [um]:      3.900E-01
#       Rmod (dry), [um]:      3.900E-01

For fog, we used the fogr00 file
