aod.py
------

Use this script to interpolate aod at a specefic wavelength
using microtops data. 
This script compute angstrom coefficient with value at 500nm
and 870nm.

aod_trend.py
------------

Use this scritp to interpolate aod at spectific time
using output of aod.py.

aod_trend aggregate data during 1 hour and find the minimum
before interpolation. We use this technique to reduce variation
associated with sight of sun.
