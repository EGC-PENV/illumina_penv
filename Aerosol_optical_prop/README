Readme file for aerosol optical properties in illumina

Illumina defines 3 aerosol models (urban, maritime, rural).
All of them having a fixed vertical scale height of 2 km.
The size distribution and composition were determined from Shettle and
Fenn 1979. For the optical calculations we used the complex refractive
index defined in OPAC v3.1 (salt, soot, waso (water soluble), inso 
(insoluble).

The calculation were made with utils/mietool assuming spefical particles
with homogeneous mixing of water for salt and waso. The codes are
derived from B. Evans Mie code.
